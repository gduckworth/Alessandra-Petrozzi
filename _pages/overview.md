## Helping Clients Transform their Business

DXC’s Hook-based campus is first and foremost a secure delivery and operations Centre, which designs, develops and maintains a wide range of solutions for our customers; this includes digital project delivery, as well as proof of concept (POC) and Minimum Viable Product (MVP) support. The Centre is place where DXC can highlight and demonstrate real life examples of digital transformation [use cases]({{ "/usecases/" | relative_url}}) that have delivered a valuable benefit to our clients

Beyond simply demonstrating **what** the Centre has acheived, the visit is also an opportunity to demonstrate **how** this was accomplished with insight into the new way of digital working that the Centre embodies. The Centre’s foundations are built on Agile and DevOps principles. These ideals are interwoven into the practice of the Centre, fostering a [culture]({{ "/culture/" | relative_url}}) of innovation and encouraging learning by doing in order to accelerate delivery and elevate performance. This ultimately culminates in a truly unique client visit experience to the Centre. 

### A Fundamentally Different Approach to Deliver IT

The Centre demonstrates the need to move away from large-scale long-term prescriptive IT contracts towards agile, transparent interactions focused on joint delivery. Traditional “Super tanker” projects are large, predefined and difficult to change, whereas new-style “speed boat” sprints are agile and enable rapid progress and development.

Super tankers are a solution first, IT-driven approach, whereas speed boat transformation focuses on business outcomes and priorities, delivering early return on investment.

The Hook Secure Digital Transformation Centre combines the power of Design Thinking and Agile application development to help clients rapidly solve business challenges delivered by multi-skilled squads organised around the Agile, Lean and DevOps principles including scrums, sprints and Kanbans, continuously integrating change and applying automation techniques as part of their day to day activities.

Clients can observe real examples of Agile delivery in action and learn about the business impacts they are making - as well as the organizational and cultural changes required to fully optimize the IT operations.
