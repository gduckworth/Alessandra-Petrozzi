## Typical Visits

Although visits to the Centre can be organised to focus on themes that clients are specifically interested in, each visit to the Centre will see firsthand digital delivery operating in the Centre.

### Product Development Approach

During a visit to the Hook Secure Digital Transformation Centre, the concepts surrounding our [Product Development Approach]({{"/pda/" | absolute_url}}) will be explained. The Product Development Approach is a framework for all the activities within the Centre detailing how digital solutions are delivered - while importantly not being prescriptive about the tools and methodologies used within each "phase" of the product cycle.

Our Product Development Approach is underpinned by Design Thinking, Agile, Lean and Devops principles. At the Centre, real valuable business outcomes are achieved by applying this new collaborative style of engagement.

To this end, teams at the Centre develop innovative solutions to Client problems such as:

- Agile Product Development delivering end to end solutions that solve a business challenge.
- Delivering automation into traditional environments
- Accelerating application migrations to the cloud  
- Enabling Rapid Business Change through automation of the lifecycle
- Developing Platforms to support cloud native application development
- And finally understanding how these products are deployed into a continuous operations model as they are hardened and scaled

### Design Studio

In addition to the delivery floors, the Centre also boasts a Design Studio. This area is a space where techniques and approaches developed for the [Pre-Discovery]({{ "/pda/prediscovery/" | relative_url}}), [Discovery]({{ "/pda/discovery/" | relative_url}}) and [Alpha]({{ "/pda/alpha/" | relative_url}}) phases of the Product Development Approach can be illustrated and observed with a number of [use case examples]({{ "/usecases/" | relative_url}}). 

The Design Studio also offers an opportunity to demonstrate the Centre's strength in providing advisory capability. The Studio is an ideal area to engage Clients in a discussion around Digital Transformation agendas and roadmaps to link to their overall strategy.

The discussion around the [culture]({{ "/culture/" | relative_url}}) we have developed in the Centre is also of importance within the Design Studio. The time spent in the Studio will explain why the working environment in the Centre has been extremely necessary and critical in the journey to Digital Transformation. The Centre has overcome a number of traditional organisational and process challenges to acheive the goal of becoming Digital. 

### Creating an Engagement Plan

Building on the topics of the day, a visit should include some time alloted to start a conversation on the opportunities and implications of this new way of working that the Centre embodies; from an account - or the Clients' perspective.

It is important to note that an Account visit to the Centre is mandatory before a Client visit. This ensures that not only does the account leadership team (AGM, DGM, ADL, CTO etc.) understand the ethos and fundamentals of the Centre, but that this time also provides an opportunity to create an engagemet plan, identify potential problem statements and/or blockers and to start tailoring the client visit. This will ultimately maximise the potential of the Client visit to the Hook Secure Digital Delivery Centre.

Some accounts have been known to engage with the Centre directly after the internal account visit to address a known problem statement and develop a first MVP Alpha prototype. This was then showcased in the Client visit to demonstrate the Centre's Digital Transformation capability - effectively facilitating and enhancing the client dialogue and engagement with a real demonstrable example of what the Centre can accomplish.

### Outcomes

The Hook Secure Digital Transformation Centre aims to deliver value to Clients from all sectors. Our use of agile working practices drives continual and consistently improving iterations that deliver valuable rapid results for our Clients. A number of the clients that have visited the Centre saw the benefits immediately and instantly understood how we could effectively solve their business issues and contribute to their business outcomes.
