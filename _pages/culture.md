## Overview

Digital Transformation is based on disruption. This does not simply mean disruption in the the types of digital solutions produced or the tools the workforce use, but also in terms of **how** the workforce operates i.e. a New Working Culture. At the Hook Secure Digital Transformation Centre we have embraced a new way of working that allows the workforce to seize Digital Transformation. This involves moving from a traditional "command and control" culture to a culture of "collaboration and trust".

Primarily for the workforce to act in an environment of self-driven learning, innovation, collaboration and ultimately self management, the New Working Culture must be fully supported by management. This requires giving the workforce a large element of freedom: The workforce must be trusted to complete their work in what they believe is the best way; giving them the power to experiment and learn; creating an environment conducive to collaboration and communication; importantly viewing "failures" or "mistakes" as opportunities to learn and apply those findings to the next next iteration of the solution.

Building on the learnings from the  [Newcastle Digital Transformation Centre](https://github.dxc.com/pages/NewcastleDigitalTransformationCentre/docs/)  the Hook Secure Digital Transformation Centre has refined the Centre Operating Model. The Centre Operating Model works on the belief that by cross-skilling development and operation teams and adding resource flexibility across the organisation based on project needs, the output and quality of the work produced is significantly improved as well as enhancing the morale and engagement of the people involved. Additionally, organisational boundaries have been eliminated such that resources can easily be moved around to best service needs and requirements.

The foundations of the SDTC are built on an Operating Model fashioned on the concepts of Agile, DevOps and Lean. The Centre demonstrates a contrast to traditional operations in a number of aspects such as: self management; multi-skilled flexible resourcing; extensive automation; robust metrics with a focus on business outcomes; and enhanced monitoring to enable continuous improvement and governance. Over time with multiple iterations and continuous process improvements (as our Agile and DevOps methodology promotes), the Centre is constantly learning and evolving the Operating Model to progress the rate and quality at which digital solutions are delivered.

With the accelerating levels of change in technology, the market place and User Experience, no one supplier has all the answers nor can deliver all of the solutions. An element of collaboration and engagement between clients (business and IT) and partners is crucial to overcome this obstacle. DXC has a rich ecosystem of technology partners, universities and R&D institutes that enables complex digital solutions to be quickly developed and delivered to achieve fast business outcomes, and a high quality customer experience. The Centre facilitates and orchestrates these conversations to ensure the digital solutions are best tailored to Clients' needs.

At the Hook Secure Digital Transformation Centre we believe that by developing and fostering a culture as described above we will not only attract the best talent, but retain and promote a workforce that is engaged to deliver quality digital products and solutions to our Clients.


To support the above there are some elements of the operating model, culture and organsiation where more information is provided

## Delivery Structure

- Each Client will have a Pod which are made up of a single or multiple Squad, Each Pod will have a Pod owner (client) and a Pod leader (DXC)
- Each Pod will have multiple Squads which will be self managing via the Product Owners (Customer Provided) and “Scrum Master” (Centre Provided)
- Squads will be multi-skilled and function, with skills and capabilities to be shaped around end to end ownership of the Products or Business Problems through development (planned work) and operations (unplanned work)
- Squads will be between 3-7 people depending product backlog, and will operate in appropriate Agile methods e.g. Scrum or Kanban
- To provide further resource pyramid optimisation and collaboration Squads supporting Products with similar skills requirements may be structured into Pods supporting multiple clients

## Developing Centre Staff


## Guilds

The Centre is currently investigating a guild structure within the Centre to support collaboration and exploit knowledge and reuse as we scale.

Our current thinking on Guilds is detailed here [Guilds]({{ "/guilds/" | relative_url}}).
