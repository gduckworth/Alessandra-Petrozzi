## C
 - Cadence - refers to the duration of (development) iterations - A Sprint is usually 2 weeks while a Program Increment would typically consist of four Sprints. In other words, the Cadence describes frequency and speed of the feedback loops of the approach.

## D
 - Design Thinking - Is a design methodology that provides a solution-based approach to solving problems - see also this article on the [5 Stages in the Design Thinking Process](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/5-stages-in-the-design-thinking-process).
 - [DevOps Dojo](https://github.dxc.com/pages/devops/dojo/) - DevOps dojo is a workshop to accelerate teams’ DevOps transformation.
 - [DevOps](https://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops/) - DevOps, short for Development and Operations, is a software engineering practice that aims at unifying software development and software operations. The main characteristic of the DevOps movement is to strongly advocate automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction, from integration, testing, releasing to deployment and infrastructure management.
 - DevSecOps - Development, Security, and Operations. Same as DevOps, but with the added philosophy of completely integrating security into the DevOps process. See DevOps.

## E
 - Epic - is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories. Epics are often used as placeholders for new ideas that have not been fully developed and yet need to be broken down into smaller components, i.e. User Stories.  

## F

## G
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) -  An awesome tool to version your source code and collaborate. Git is a version control system that tracks changes to files in a project over time. It typically records what the changes were, who made the changes, notes and comments about the changes by the changer and when the changes were made. It is primarily used for software development projects which are often collaborative, so in this sense, it is a tool to help enable and improve collaboration.
 - [GitHub](https://github.dxc.com/) - GitHub is a Web-based Git version control repository hosting service. It is mostly used for computer code but is used for other files as well. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
 - [Guild]({{ "/guilds/" | relative_url }}) -  is a community of members with shared interests. These are a group of people across the organization who want to share knowledge, tools code and practices.

## H

## I
 - [Industrialized Delivery Model (IDM)](https://my.dxc.com/our-company/operating-model/deliver/Bionix/IDM.html) - The single global DXC delivery operating model that governs how our Delivery organizations meet our clients’ contractual obligations. At the core of the IDM is the creation of leveraged, multi-disciplined teams created to support accounts and clients. These functionally-focused delivery teams are called Hubs and are designed to provide the most efficient end-to-end services for our clients. Our [Journey to ZeroOps video](https://video.dxc.com/media/t/1_hsywx6t5) explains this as well.

## J
 - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - A very powerful static site generator. When used alongside GitHub, Jekyll will automatically re-generate all the HTML pages for your website each time you commit a file.
 - [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) - An open source, lightweight [CI](#c) tool written in Java, with high extensibility and a fast release cycle.
 - [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) - Jira is a proprietary agile platform, developed by Atlassian. It provides bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management functions.

## K
 - [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) - A method for managing the creation of products with an emphasis on continual delivery while not overburdening the development team. Like Scrum, Kanban is a process designed to help teams work together more effectively. It is based on three basic principles (1) Visualize what you do today (workflow); (2) Limit the amount of work in progress; (3) Enhance flow;

## L
 - [Leading Edge Forum (LEF)](https://leadingedgeforum.com/) - is a DXC independent Think Tank, a global research and thought leadership programme dedicated to helping clients reimagine their organizations and leadership for a tech-driven future. The LEF serves as a strategic touchpoint for CXO Teams to provoke and challenge their thinking to help them win in the 21st century.

## M
 - [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) - Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.
 - Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - is a way of conceptualizing a product as an experiment to confirm and test your riskiest assumptions and hypotheses. It is important to understand the [difference between MVP, Prototype and Proof of Concept]({{"/pda/terminology/" | absolute_url}})). It is a concept from Lean Startup that stresses the impact of learning in new product development. Eric Ries defined an MVP as that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. See also Eric Ries' post on [Startup Lessons Learned](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html).

## N

## O
 - [Open Source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) - Open source software (as an alternative to commercial software), is software whose source code is published and made available to the public, enabling anyone to copy, modify and improve the software.

## P
 - [Platform DXC](https://github.dxc.com/pages/Platform-dxc/docs/) - is our digital-generation delivery platform that underpins Bionix and provides intelligence, orchestration and automation services to our managed service offerings. Platform DXC be described as the framework by which we will modernize the delivery of business enabled services via technology, while also providing the means to create digital assets that enable transformation for DXC, our partners, and our clients. See also [Tim Henderson's white paper on Platform DXC](https://dxc.facebook.com/download/preview/195188607891724) on workplace. Great quote from Chris Swan:  _"Platform DXC is not 'a thing'. We are building a factory for continuous delivery pipelines that can be used to implement 'Platform DXCs', in context."_
 - POC - Proof of Concept. Also see the side-by-side comparison of MVP, Prototype and Proof of Concept to [understand the differences]({{"/pda/terminology/" | absolute_url}}).
 - [Problem Statement]({{"/pda/problemstatement/" | relative_url}}) - A problem statement is a brief description of the issues that need to be addressed by a problem solving team and should be presented to them (or created by them) before they try to solve a problem. A good problem statement should focus on business outcomes rather than the technology.
 - Product Backlog - contains all the User Stories and artifacts that the development team need to address. Entries in the Product Backlog are ordered and prioritized (a responsibility of the Product Owner), every entry adds value to the customer and every entry is estimated. The Product Backlog is of course a living document.
 - [Public Cloud](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/public-cloud) - Services offered over the public Internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase the service.

## Q

## R

## S
 - [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/what-is-safe/) - is an industry recognised framework that has developed an approach (supporting a number of configurations) aimed at helping businesses address the challenges of developing large, enterprise class systems and software utilising three key foundations: Agile Development, Systems Thinking and Lean Product Development. See our [DXC Scaled Agile Framework page]({{"/scaleddigitalframework/" | absolute_url}}) for more details.
 - Scrum - A subset of Agile software development where a small team continuously delivers working software according to a backlog and regular goals as set by the team’s Product Manager.
 - Service Design - refers to an approach to managed innovation that helps organisations work out what to build next.
 - Sprint - A short period (1-2 weeks) where a scrum team works towards an incremental goal as set up by the teams’ Product Manager. The term Sprint is a Scrum term for an iteration. At the Hook Secure Digital Transformation Centre a Sprint is usually a 2-week time period.

## T

## U
 - [User Experience Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/comprehensive-guide-user-experience-design/) - is the continuous application of user centered design techniques to optimize a product around user need and usability.
 - User Stories  - are short, simple (non-technical) descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person (persona) who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. Either the Product Owner or the team writes the user stories according to the following structure: _As a [type of user], I want to [perform some task] so I can [achieve some goal]_. To assess the workload effort needed to complete the story, user stories are assigned story points. Once the product owner prioritizes the user stories, the team breaks the highest priority story down into tasks to be completed during the next iteration or sprint.

## V
 - [Vision](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/vision/) - is a description of the future state of the solution under development. It reflects customer and stakeholder needs, as well as features and capabilities proposed to meet those needs. The vision is both aspirational and achievable, providing the broader context — an overview and purpose — of the solution under development. It describes the markets, customer segments, and user needs. It sets the boundaries and context for new features, non-functional requirements (NFRs), and other work. In the Digital Transformation Centre we are experimenting with "videos scripts" as a different way of storytelling to articulate a Vision. See also: [An example of a Product Vision](https://video.dxc.com/media/t/1_akgtaufc/94683232).  
 - Value Stream Mapping - is a lean management tool that helps visualize the steps needed to take from product creation to delivering it to the end-customer. It is the process of aligning the entire team on the steps, process, timings and constraints of each value stream and prioritising improvement steps. (Listen to John Ediger talk about [Value Stream Mapping on DevOps Office Hours](
 https://dxc.facebook.com/groups/DevOpsGroup/permalink/1522575547864737/)).
