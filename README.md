Build Status: [![Build Status](https://jenkins.platformdxc.com/buildStatus/icon?job=AET/OurSite/master)](https://jenkins.platformdxc.com/job/AET/job/OurSite/job/master/)

This [template site](https://github.dxc.com/pages/AET/OurSite/index.html) has been created specifically to provide an site that can be easily cloned and tailored for use by other teams. Our goal - to lower the bar for other teams to create their own GitHub pages...

The content of this site is described in more detail [here](https://github.dxc.com/pages/AET/OurSite/oursite/). This page outlines what parts of the repo are part of the underlying theme and what is the content that is specific to the Global Tooling SMEs and can be updated/removed when tailoring for your own site. Refer to [SME Central](https://github.dxc.com/pages/AET/EDGE-Central/Pages/Ops_Home.html) for the actual content for the team.

Instructions for replicating this site are available [here](https://github.dxc.com/pages/AET/OurSite/tailor/).

**Note:** The dicts folder, the dockerfile.* files and the _config_dev.yml/_config_htmlproofer.yml are used for the Jenkinsfile automation. This has been configured to automatically spell check and link check the pages as content is updated. 

**Warning**: Users can tailor the theme content, but caution should be taken. The theme supports cross platform access, i.e., PCs, phones, etc., using responsive HTML, so many of the underlying styles are designed to adjust display based on display format, etc. Changing styles can have unexpected consequences.
