This article is intended for users that are not sure if and how GitHub could be useful to them with their day to day work. To many GitHub is seen only as a tool to version control source code, hopefully we can convince everyone that it is more than that and can provide value to all users, not just developers.  To do this we shall compare and contract GitHub with other common office productivity tools, that most people would be familiar with. 

# Version Control #

Let's start with the obvious topic - GitHub is a version control tool for source code... Why would other users need it, SharePoint and One Drive both support versioning and this is a valid point. In many scenarios, these are optimal solutions.

Where GitHub is different is that it can version, i.e., automatically maintain the update history. 

What you can also do in GitHub is:
- create snapshots of content, for example, to identify all the appropriate versions of different content associated with a specific milestone - so think all the collateral linked with a specific project or product milestone. So you can always go back and see earlier versions of specific items and the associated versions of related items.
- easily manage multiple replicas of the same content, for example to make it very easy for users to identify the last approved version of the item, while content updates are in progress. This can be invaluable if you are updating work instructions, where users are relying on the availability of an earlier version, while content is in the process of being enhanced. GitHub provides the ability to manage the replicas (called branches) and easily synchronize any changes across each branch when needed.

GitHub is also predicated on the principles of 'crowd collaboration' - think how Microsoft releases betas so users can provide 'free' testing services... It provides the option to allow DXC users outside of your immediate team to create their now replica of content, enhance and then submit a request to potentially incorporate (merge) these enhancements into the master copy. You can now take advantage of the expertise and experience of any and all users in DXC... To do this in SharePoint or OneDrive you have to specifically grant access to users to do this once you know who they are.

Where OneDrive or SharePoint are the better solution in is where online simultaneous collaboration is required for Office files, e.g., Excel, Word, etc. For example, multiple users can work simultaneously on Word documents stored in a shared OneDrive and see each others changes near real-time. This is not an option with GitHub, which provides the ability to store and version these types of files, but not to support simultaneous edits or merging of updates.


# Features #

## Organizations and Repos ##
GitHub supports scalability, providing the ability for individual users to create and maintain their own repos (a repository is a file container, i.e., similar concept to a document library in SharePoint) and for larger teams or accounts to create organizations, which act as groupings for related repos and simplify how access is granted to individual users across these repos.

## Forks and Clones ##
The web UI in GitHub provides basic edit access for basic content, however, often it is easier to make updates offline or bulk upload from your PC. To do this in GitHub, you essentially copy the content to your PC (called cloning). This is an easy process using the GitHub Desktop client, which helps you manage the file hierarchy and synchronize any changes or new files added to the local copy to the master copy in GitHub. Additionally, if other users are also making changes and uploaded it, the Desktop client also makes it easy to synchronize those changes to your local copy. This is similar to what you see with OneDrive, although you control when these updates are synchronized. 

Users that have read access to content in a repo, but no direct edit access content, can create a copy of that repo if they want to contribute (called a fork - think how a road can split, so you can have a single starting point, but multiple destinations). Then, this user can make changes in their own copy and use for their own purposes (think re-use) or send a request to 'contribute' those updates back to the source (think crowd sourcing). The owner has the option to accept of reject these changes.

## GitHub Pages ##
GitHub provides built in static web hosting - supporting markdown and html. Provides less feature rich environment than SharePoint, but provides a simple solution for teams that do require the complexity that SharePoint provides. This is a really easy way to create an window into you team for other users.

## GitHub Issues ##
GitHub provides simple issue tracking, with support to create labels and milestones to group and categorize these items. Also, provides integrated change management, by associating commits to the issue that triggered the updates.

## GitHub Projects ##
GitHub provides a simple kanban facility where you can create a simple board view that shows the status of your issues based on user-defined states.

## GitHub Wikis ##
GitHub provides the ability for users to create simple wiki pages to share simple content using markdown. This could be simple process documents, work aids, role descriptions, etc. By using markdown, you remove the focus on format, so users can concentrate on content. It also makes them easier to view updates and collaborate on content because this is text content, so much easier in terms of merging from multiple sources.

# Examples - How this might be useful? #

['Examples' not use cases...regular folks don't talk that way. Alternatively, what can I use this for?]

## Create a simple web site ##
Do you want to create an easy web presence - GitHub pages allow you do that very quickly? This helps communicate to your team, e.g., events, key processes, roadmaps, where to find support, anything you like. It is an easy alternative to web hosting from SharePoint, is more engaging than OneNote and becoming more popular with cross-functional teams. 

This site was created from ground up using the Minimal Mistakes remote theme in a few days. By providing guidance for replication, other users should be able to recreate this framework for their own use in less than an hour? As more users build more sites, the options for leveraging that content are endless....

[Most of our users won't do this or relate...we need non-IT examples as well]

## Host support content ##
Do you want to create guidance documents or usage guides?

We generate our help file content using Adobe RoboHelp. The source files are mostly html, css, images, etc. By migrating to GitHub, we now manage the source files in the same location we publish. This has eliminated a huge complexity and failure points in our previous process using a SharePoint for publication and a different tool to manage the source content.

# Getting Started with GitHub #
For anyone that wants to get their feet web and just start learning about GitHub by using it - GitHub is accessible to all DXC users and is available at no cost to end users. This includes an environment where teams can collaborate with external partners or customers. GitHub already has a very large user base and there are lots of resources to help people get started.
