## Overview

The Alpha phase remains design led and is a natural extension of the Discovery phase, but with an emphasis on exploring options, prioritising and prototyping to create the required technical learning. We may change our mind and iterate regularly during this phase as we search for an MVP that works for service users and delivers value to your organisation.

The Alpha phase also encompasses technical discovery of relevant technologies, the technical skills required, high level technical requirements, availability and robustness through population of the Solution Canvas.

Finally, the Alpha phase concludes with an assessment of whether to continue to production quality software delivery based on user and organisational value.

Key Activities within the Alpha phase, to the extent permitted by the available capacity, include:
- Refine the Product Backlog, using fully elaborated, prioritised User Stories with complete requirements, acceptance criteria (corresponding to the definition of “Done”) and background on current pain points
- Elaborate options for the toolset, architecture and overall framework
- Discuss and agree the best architecture and toolset
- Agree the target development environments to be used
- Create Prototypes to test hypotheses, methods, tools and processes and gather validated learning
- Develop the key components required by the Minimum Viable Product
- Create the Minimum Viable Product, test & execute
- Deliver “Show and Tell” of the MVP to appropriate stakeholders
- Develop recommendations/proposal for Beta phase to be agreed with Product Owner based upon learnings from prototypes and MVP
- Maintain a prioritised Product Backlog

In this phase the Squad will, to facilitate the quick creation of the MVP, seek to use Open Source tools that are available and appropriate. If the MVP validates the underlying hypotheses, these tools may later be replaced with proprietary software/tools for the Beta and/or Live phases, if more appropriate for the requirements of, and usage in, these phases.

Throughout the Alpha phase the Product Owner may add or remove requirements to the Sprint Backlog. Any such changes will be governed through the Scrum Master and Product Owner. In such cases:
- where additional requirements are requested, Product Owner and Scrum Master shall either remove other requirements (that would require the same capacity as new requirements) from the Backlog of the relevant Sprint and re-prioritise them in the Product Backlog, or agree a revised capacity sufficient to deliver the new requirements; or
- Where requirements are requested to be removed by the Product Owner, Product Owner and Scrum Master shall add further items from the Product Backlog (that would require the same capacity as the capacity freed up by the removal).

Throughout this phase the Product Owner may also add or remove requirements to the Product Backlog to be delivered in further iterations or later phases (Beta or Live).

## Actors
- Product Owner - Provided by the account or client
- Scrum Master
- Squad Members depending on type of skills required
    - Technical Lead, Application Solution Lead  
    - UI/UX Designer   
    - Developers, DevOps Engineers

- Other Stakeholders  
    - Delivery Lead (DDL)  
    - Digital Enterprise Architect (DEA)  
    - Business Owner   
    - Other SMEs (whose input is required)

## Inputs (from Discovery)
- Elaborated Problem Statement
- Confirmed Vision / Postcard from the Future
- Prioritised Product Backlog
- Defined Minimum Viable Product and Hypothesis
- Sprint Plan

## Outputs
 - Minimum Viable Product ready to move into the productive environment
 - Recommendations/proposal for Beta (agreed with Product Owner) based upon learnings from prototypes and MVP
 - Prioritised Product Backlog for Beta (incorporating operational learnings to be sought in Beta)
 - Sprint Plan for Beta and a (less detailed) plan for Live

## Tools and Techniques
As already done during the Discovery phase, standard "Scrum" ceremonies will be continued to be run by the scrum master including:
- Retrospectives
- Show and Tell
- Sprint Planning

Tools used within the Digital Transformation Centre to support this phase include:
- Jira, Trello, VSTS to support task ownership, Kanban and User Stories
- Confluence for Documentation for example Decision Logs, Personas etc.
