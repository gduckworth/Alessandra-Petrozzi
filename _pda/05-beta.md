## Overview

During Beta we have a greater confidence in product success. User needs, usability and organisational value have been identified and we focus on writing robust production quality code. We aim to release a public version of the new product or service as soon as possible to gather quantitative user data.

In this phase, the Squad will  
- Review the results/ output from the Alpha phase
- Gather data on the MVP’s performance in a production environment
- Prepare the MVP for introduction to Live
- Industrialise (e.g. develop production quality code adopting tools that can support deployment at scale and support security requirements in Live) and begin to scale the MVP as it develops into a Product or Service
- Develop further iterations of the MVP and enhance features of the Product or Service (with an emphasis on the production environment), in accordance with the prioritised backlog
- Continuously test the MVP with a section of the user community and obtain feedback which can be incorporated into the Product Backlog
- Develop operational learning about the Product or Service
- Identify and measure key metrics & KPIs to demonstrate success
- Continue to evolve the prioritised Product Backlog
- Engage with the support team(s) for the development of operational learning and in preparation for Live (including, as appropriate or required: up-skilling of the team, defining the support model, setting up metrics and analytics)
- Address any sign-offs, approvals, certifications required for full roll-out

As we move towards ‘Live’, data drives the decision making process. During Beta the team will make an assessment of their readiness to move to Live, based on robustness, user value, organisational value as well as KPIs and metrics.

Throughout this phase the Product Owner may continue to add or remove requirements to a Sprint Backlog. Any such changes will be governed through the Scrum Master and Product Owner. In such cases:   
- Where additional requirements are requested, the Product Owner and Scrum Master shall either remove other requirements (that would require the same capacity as new requirements) from the scope of the relevant Sprint and re-prioritise them in the Product Backlog, or agree a revised capacity sufficient to deliver the new requirements; or
- Where requirements are requested to be removed by the Product Owner, the Product Owner and Scrum Master shall add further items from the Product Backlog (that would require the same capacity as the capacity freed up by the removal).

## Actors  
- Product Owner - Provided by the account or client
- Scrum Master
- Squad Members
- Users (a section or sub-set of the overall user community)
- Members of identified support team(s)
- Other Stakeholders  
    - Delivery Lead (DDL)  
    - Business Owner   
    - Other SMEs (whose input is required)

## Inputs (from Alpha)   
- Minimum Viable Product ready to move into the productive environment
- Recommendations/proposal for Beta (agreed with Product Owner) based upon learnings from prototypes and MVP
- Prioritised Product Backlog for Beta (incorporating operational learnings to be sought in Beta)
- Sprint Plan for Beta and a (less detailed) plan for Live

## Outputs   
- "Hardened" Product or Service - Support Model defined and ready to take on the ongoing support
- KPIs and Metrics defined, analytics set up to measure success of the Product or Service
- Sprint plan for transition to Live
