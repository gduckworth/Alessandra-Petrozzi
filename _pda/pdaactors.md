The following are some of the key roles throughout the Product Development Approach.  

## The Squad (i.e. the Core Team)

|Actor|Summary|Detail|
|---|---|---|
|Product Owner | Owns the outcomes of the business solution/product-focused work (development, composition, integration) at each phase of the life cycle; serves as the “voice of the client” if the client is not directly involved. |[Scrum Guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eljozEWpf8); [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-product-owner); [Responsibilities detail]({{ "/pda/productowner/" | relative_url}});|
|Scrum Master/ Delivery Lead | Facilitator (scrum.org uses the term "servant-leader") for agile teams who removes any obstacles stopping a team from achieving the required outcomes of a sprint. The Scrum Master helps those outside the team understand which of their interactions with the team are helpful and which aren’t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the team.|[Scrum Guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbPkcfzi2HI); [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-scrum-master)|
|Development Team| Consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment. Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Team’s overall efficiency and effectiveness. They are self-organizing and multi-skilled (i.e. all required skills are contained within the team).|[Scrum Guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLqCkj0PvtE); [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-scrum-development-team)|
