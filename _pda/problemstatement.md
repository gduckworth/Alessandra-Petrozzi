In Digital Transformation we try to start with a problem statement as opposed to a set of requirements. During Pre-Discovery we gather information to detail the problem area we need to address (create a value map of the process in question, engage with respective stakeholders, etc.) and use it to create a problem statement. A problem statement should also describe ways that you will know (or measure) when you have solved the problem.

A good problem statement should focus on business outcomes rather than the technology.  

If you have trouble writing a narrow problem statement, brainstorm all the projectâ€™s possible goals, needs and measurable criteria first. Then work as a group to select the most important ones and build your problem statement from there. This process may reveal multiple problem statements. Your team will need to work to figure out which problem to pursue, and how to scope the statement so there are some constraints around what the team is taking on.
