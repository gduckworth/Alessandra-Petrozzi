The **Product Owner** is the key representative if the Customer in a Squad and must have full decision making authority on behalf of Customer. The Product Owner, in consultation with the Scrum Master, will provide direction and sign-offs to the Scrum both on a daily basis, for each iteration or Sprint and regarding the final outcome and therefore requires an appropriate level of empowerment.

Ideally the Product Owner will be experienced with the Agile methodology - and have sufficient amount of time available to be able to fulfill the role and the work involved. In particular the Product Owner will have the following responsibilities:
- Provide input to establish Problem Statement and Vision in Pre-Discovery
- Create and prioritise the initial Product Backlog
- Work with all relevant client stakeholders to clearly define User Stories for delivery into the Product Backlog
- Ensure the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed
- Validate User Stories and the criteria to meet the relevant definition of “Done” and that these are suitable for delivery by the Squad
- Revise and re-prioritise the Product Backlog on an ongoing basis
- Keep all relevant client stakeholders informed of progress and decisions
- Attend daily standups to enable clarification by the Squad and provide direction and sign off
- Respond quickly to questions from the Squad, obtaining clarification on open points from all relevant client stakeholders where required
- Escalate blockers which he/ she cannot resolve to the sponsoring Senior Executive for resolution
- Ensure business readiness for items delivered from Squad
- Provide access to all required SMEs and any other required client personnel (the Product Owner may also be an SME)
