## Overview

The Discovery phase is all about driving a common view of the Problem Statement and Vision - and ensuring that the Sprints in the Alpha phase can successfully start. The Discovery phase is typically performed over a period of 1 to 3 weeks (depending upon scope of the Problem Statement), via workshops and close collaborative working sessions with the actors.

Any Discovery phase is likely to begin with a Kick-off or Scoping Workshop with all relevant stakeholders. During this session the Problem Statement is elaborated through the creation of User Stories, appropriate environments are established, a prioritised Product Backlog is created along with the initial Sprint Plan. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is defined.

Key activities within this phase include:

- Establish the Squad, required tools (including collaboration tools), environments, access requirements, processes and Sprint Plan (Sprint Cadence, and Agile methods to be used).
- Identify relevant Stakeholders and SMEs whose input or approval will be required.
- Refine, evolve and detail the Problem Statement.
- Create a Vision, this will include the "Known Future" and "Unknown Future" and may be created as a VideoScript or Video representation.
- Establish an initial Product Backlog through the conversion of the Problem Statement into User Stories.
- Elaborate and, as directed by the product Owner, prioritise the initial Product Backlog.
- Identify possible blockers and constraints.
- Define "Ready" and "Done" (a responsibility of the Product Owner).
- Develop and, where possible, verify assumptions through experimentation.
- Develop a hypothesis aligned with the agreed Problem Statement.
- Define the MVP that is to be used to test the hypothesis and deliver the necessary validated learning.
- Identify additional Skills / Roles required for the Alpha phase.
- Develop a Sprint Plan for the Alpha phase.
- Deliver “Show and Tell” to all stakeholders regarding the proposals for the Alpha phase including the intended MVP and Alpha Sprint Plan.

## Actors
- Product Owner - Provided by the account or client
- Scrum Master
- Key Squad Members  
    - E.g. Technical Lead, Application Solution Lead  
    - UI/UX Designers (if appropriate)

- Other Stakeholders  
    - Delivery Lead (DDL)  
    - Digital Enterprise Architect (DEA)
    - SMEs required to provide input

## Inputs (from Pre-Discovery)
- Business Outcomes
- Roadmap
- Problem Statement(s)
- Blueprint

## Outputs
- Elaborated Problem Statement
- Confirmed Vision / Postcard from the Future
- Prioritised Product Backlog
- Defined Minimum Viable Product and Hypothesis
- Sprint Plan

Core outputs of the Discovery Phase are listed below with templates and examples.  Additional outputs may also be generated depending upon the context of the Development

**Core Outputs** | **Description** | **Template** or  **Example**
-------------| ------------ |--------
**Elaborated Problem Statement** | The Problem Statement created in Pre-Discovery will be verified , and elaborated to ensure that everyone has a common understanding and that all aspects of the Problem are identified with appropriate outcomes defined. The Problem Statement is the basis for each Squad’s work (rather than a predefined scope statement).|  [Writing a Problem Statement]({{ "/pda/problemstatement/" | relative_url}})
**Vision** | The Vision is a description of the future state of the solution under development. It reflects customer and stakeholder needs, as well as features and capabilities proposed to meet those needs. The vision is both aspirational and achievable, providing the broader context — an overview and purpose — of the solution under development. It describes the markets, customer segments, and user needs. It sets the boundaries and context for new features, non-functional requirements (NFRs), and other work. In the Digital Transformation Centre we are experimenting with "videos scripts" of a Vision. | [Video: An example of a Product Vision](https://video.dxc.com/media/t/1_akgtaufc/94683232).  
**Personas** | The goal is to bring your users to life by developing personas with real names, personalities, motivations, and often even a photo. In other words, a good persona is highly personalized.  These Personas are used to validate the vision and develop the User Stories.  |
**User Stories** | are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template: ***As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >***. |
**MVP Definition and Hypothesis** | Define what the initial hypotheses(s) that is needed to be proven in the first element of development of the vision, and defining what the Minimum viable Product is to support these Hypotheses.  This is something which typically should be proven with the first 2-4 sprints in Alpha |
**Prioritised Product Backlog** | The User Stories developed with the Product Owner will be prioritised based upon the vision, MVP and capacity of the team |


## Tools & Techniques

During the Discovery phase, standard "Scrum" ceremonies should be run by the scrum master including:
- Retrospectives
- Show and Tell
- Sprint Planning

Tools used within the Digital Transformation Centre to support this phase include:
- Jira, Trello, VSTS to support task ownership, Kanban and User Stories
- Confluence for Documentation for example Decision Logs, Personas etc.
