## Overview

To accelerate a Digital Transformation journey, our approach brings assets and experience to each client situation in a collaborative manner to produce results. Working together, advisors help account or client teams to:
 - build end-to-end digital transformation roadmaps.
 - co-create business and architecture blueprints through feedback and learning.
 - identify blockers and enablers through the delivery of change using Agile, Lean and DevOps principles – ‘learn by doing’.
 - apply pre-built advisor frameworks to help teams create directional and detailed business cases, new governance models and target IT operating models.
 - develop new contracting frameworks which promote multi-vendor environments, quick on-boarding of new vendors and avoid lock-in.
 - apply and implement Digital Transformation Centre Blueprints.

A Pre-Discovery phase exists in different forms depending upon the context (Pathway) regarding where the account or client is within their specific Digital Transformation journey. The Pre-Discovery phase may exist of a single structured workshop or of a series of workshops with collaboration between account and client to develop the required outcomes.
All Pre-Discovery activity should be done within the context of the [Digital Bootcamp Process](https://my.dxc.com/our-company/operating-model/sell/client--account-and-business-operations/ASP/Bootcamp.html).

The Pre-Discovery phase needs to establish enough information to create a proposal and clarify any internal resource requirements. At any point during Pre-Discovery, single or multiple [Discovery]({{ "/pda/discovery/" | relative_url}}) sessions may be spawned.

Example Pathways include (a Pre-Discovery phase may consist of all three Pathways as it develops):

 - **General Digital Transformation Roadmap Creation**  
Working collaboratively to create an overall Digital Transformation Roadmap based upon the themes identified in the account's Business Value Framework, identifying a number of opportunities for early delivery which are translated into [Business Problem Statements]({{ "/pda/problemstatement/" | relative_url}}).

 - **Transformation to a Digital Account**  
Working collaboratively to create a roadmap for the account focused on transformation of the account delivery and operations capabilities to enable future digital delivery, including evidence based operations analysis to accelerate the IDM model, identifying a number of opportunities for early delivery which are translated into [Business Problem Statements]({{ "/pda/problemstatement/" | relative_url}}).

 - **Initiative Elaboration**  
If a specific initiative has already been shaped, then the Pre-Discovery phase looks at elaborating the initiative and translating it into a specific [Business Problem Statement]({{ "/pda/problemstatement/" | relative_url}}) by understanding the current situation, blockers and wants or needs of the initiative. The focus is to rapidly gather enough information to move into the next phase of the approach.

[The different workshops supporting the above pathways are defined Here]({{ "/pda/assets/Pre-Discovery-Workshops" | relative_url}})

## Actors

Any individual with contributing ideas are welcome in the Pre-Discovery phase, but they should be empowered to make decisions to avoid cycles of discussions.  

From the Digital Transformation Centre likely contributors    
 - Digital Transformation Principal
 - Digital Transformation Associate
 - Digital Architect
 - Delivery Leader
 - Scrum Master
 - Technical Lead

From the Account and Client likely Contributors  
 - Digital General Manager (DGM)
 - Account General Manager (AGM)
 - Account CT / Digital Enterprise Architect (DEA)
 - Digital Delivery lead (DDL)
 - Account Delivery Lead (ADL), Run Lead (ARL), Projects Lead (APL) where relevant
 - Industry Advisors
 - Business Owner (Product Owner)

## Inputs

Pre-Discovery is about collating the required information to support the themes and initiative and ensuring that decisions are made with associated evidence, so there are no defined inputs but many of the required artifacts may already exist as part of the Account Strategic Plan such as Business Value Frameworks, architectural visions, operational data.  

## Outputs

Core outputs of Pre-Discovery are listed below with templates and examples. Additional outputs may also be generated depending upon the context of the Pre-Discovery phase.

**Core Outputs** | **Description** | **Template** or **Example**
-------------| ------------ |--------
**Strategic Themes**       |Strategic Themes are differentiating business objectives that connect a product or products  to the strategy of the Enterprise. They provide business context for prioritisation and decision-making and serve as inputs to the vision, budget, and backlogs for the product(s). |  
**Blueprint**              | The blueprint defines the constraints which need to be applied, a high level vision and principles for the new model, a solution canvas and any KPIs or outcomes required |
**Mapped Service Journey** | A customer journey map is a story designed to provide insights into the customer’s journey. It is not designed to represent a 100% real experience but should show key items such as current pain points, "wait times", improvements, etc. |
**Transformation Roadmap** | The transformation roadmap is a high level illustration of the elements of the strategic theme or initiative which needs to take place to achieve the Business outcomes.  it will never be static. |
**Problem Statement**      | A problem statement is a brief description of the issues that need to be addressed by a problem solving team and should be presented to them (or created by them) before they try to solve the problem.|  [Writing a Problem Statement]({{ "/pda/problemstatement/" | relative_url}})

## Tools and Techniques

Pre-Discovery phase is centered on Collaboration and Evidence. At this stage the outputs are the tools which are predominantly office based documents e.g. PowerPoint presentations.  

The Newcastle Centre can facilitate workshops to drive the outcomes.

Some example tools may be used such as:
- MooD Business Landscape Tool
- DXC IQ Dashboards (CKM Analytics)
